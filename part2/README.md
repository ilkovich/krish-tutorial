Write a function that returns the sum of the digits of an integer.

sumOfDigits(x);

If x is 234, the function should return 2 + 3 + 4, that is, 9.

If x is 12, the function should return 1 + 2, which is 3.

If x is 39, the function should return 12.

If x is negative, ignore the minus sign. For example, -12 and 12 both return 3.

Use recursion.
